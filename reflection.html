                            At the beginning of this project, we first had to spend some time choosing a task and figuring out how the task could be solved in the best way possible. We noticed that we were in a hectic period with multiple mandatory assignments due to about the same time, we therefore started early with the tasks which gave us plenty of time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the first meeting, we concurred to create a menu for an Italian restaurant and created a GitHub repository where each one could contribute. We were unsure of how the website structure / design should be, in terms of colors, layouts etc. To solve this problem, we decided to create a simple website each, and vote for the one that fell in taste for most. Then we had several meetings, where we went through the code and discussed the accessibility of the website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the first website, we implemented several measures to ensure universal accessibility. We used contrasting colors like black and white to make the website more color blind friendly. Aesthetically, we have used red and white extensively to suit the colors of the Italy – the origin of our food items. In terms of language, we have improved universal accessibility by including translations for Italian words, such as “dessert” (English) for “dolci” (Italian). We chose a fitting font style for our titles which is readable yet subtly stylish.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We chose to have a simple page with everything on one page. However, more pages can be added as more functionality is required, e.g. ordering and payment systems.The webpage follows a structured design where food items are organized by appropriate categories like appetizers, salads, main courses, and desserts. For the categories with few food items, we’ve added photos to support the users with their decision-making.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Appropriate headings were added: h1 contains the name of the restaurant, “Italianou”, and the h2 headings are the food categories offered by the business. The page is marked up using meaningful elements: The first element in the body is the header, which contains the top navigation bar, followed by main tag with an encompassing article element, and finally a footer element. Non-essential script tags have been placed at the bottom of body.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also wanted to challenge ourselves and added Jquery to utilize click features, which enhanced the webpage with supportive functionality like automatic page scrolling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The collaboration itself went very well; we discussed during meetings and came up with good solutions together. Through this course, we feel that we have gained a good understanding of HTML and CSS so far. In addition, we debugged the codes with WCAG which helped everyone understand exactly how to solve the problems.
