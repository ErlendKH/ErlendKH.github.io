                        <h2>Definitions</h2>

                        <p>Accessibility has the goal of removing all barriers (technical, physical or cognitive) to
                            serving the
                            product
                            or service to someone. Web accessibility is the the inclusive practice of removing barriers
                            that prevent
                            interaction with, or access to, websites by people with disabilities. It also includes the
                            degree of
                            ease
                            and effectiveness a web system can be accessed and used.</p>

                        <h2>WCAG</h2>

                        <p>In Norway, web accessibility is required by law in which websites need to comply with the
                            recommendations
                            set
                            by WCAG 2.1 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). WCAG follows four key principles with
                            the acronym
                            “POUR”: (P) Perceivable, (O) Operable, (U) Understandable, and (R) Robust.</p>

                        <h2>Disabilities Affected By Accessibility</h2>

                        <p>Disabilities are grouped into five main categories: (1) <span>visual impairments</span>, (2)
                            <span>auditory impairments</span>, (3)
                            <span>motor impairments</span>, (4) <span>cognitive impairments</span>, and (5)
                            <span>vestibular disorders and seizures</span>.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Examples Of Best Practices</h3>

                        <p>In regards to <span>visual impairments</span>, the text on the website needs to be clearly
                            visible, and the website
                            need
                            to take color blindness into consideration. In the case where the user is blind, the website
                            need to be
                            suit
                            screen reading software and navigation through keyboard exclusively. Furthermore, images in
                            context
                            require
                            alternative text. In addition, it is useful to have a basic navigation design to further
                            enhance their
                            web
                            experience.</p>

                        <p><span>Auditory impairments</span> are important to facilitate for when including audio and
                            videos on the website.</p>

                        <p>Examples of good practices for dealing with <span>motor impairments</span> is full keyboard
                            support, simple
                            navigation,
                            and links and buttons of sufficiently large sizes.</p>

                        <p>Examples of good practices for dealing with <span>cognitive impairments</span> are using
                            simple navigation, avoiding
                            complex sentences, avoiding blinking and moving content, and the ability to pause/stop
                            audio, video, and
                            animation content.</p>

                        <p>For <span>vestibular disorders and seizures</span>, it is important to avoid flickering or
                            flashing lights, and either
                            minimize the use of animations and automatic scrolling or give the user accessible control
                            over it (turn
                            on/off).</p>

                            <p>We tested the website’s facilitation for color blindness with <a

                                The greyscale test
                                shows that most of the text has sufficient contrast. However, the title on the pages
                                could potentially
                                fail
                                WCAG’s AAA contrast ratio requirement. This in turn is difficult for us to test with the
                                <a title="WebAIM Contrast Checker - Finds the contrast ratio between a foreground and background color."

                                because we do not use a
                                hardcoded color value for the background, but rather alpha filters on top of a fairly
                                bright image to
                                darken it. Then again,

                            <p>To further enhance the accessibility for visually impaired individuals, we have added
                                full keyboard support. By pressing the TAB button, the user will first see a “Skip to
                                content” button. Next, the navigation links will be highlighted one by one with a black
                                border. The user can activate any of the focused links with ENTER, and otherwise move
                                vertically with the up and down arrow keys. </p>
